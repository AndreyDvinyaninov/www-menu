    Static bookmarks
    ( google translate )

  Bookmarks in browsers are dynamic temporary bookmarks.
  You can create an HTML file to create a menu from links to sites and their themes.
  You need a notepad editor to create and edit such a file.
  Simple editors are needed because they do not change the file encoding.
  Complex editors automatically change the Russian encoding when saving
  files. This causes the file to be thrown away and the file to be recreated.

  I'm not an expert on notepad-type editors. A random search turned up Akelpad.

  Example work method.
  This is ru "windows-1251" coding.
  Create directory C:\MENU.
  We take a simple notepad editor and copy the contents:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
<head>
<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=windows-1251">
<meta charset="windows-1251">

</head>

<body>
<br>
Menu - New window

<a href="https://youtube.com/" target="_blank">
  - youtube

  We save it to a file, for example 1WWW-2023.HTML in the C:\MENU directory.

  Next, click on this file and Windows will call the browser by file type
  and get something like this:

Menu - New window

- youtube
- Y2Mate Youtube Downloader - DOWNLOAD IN LOW QUALITY

- aliexpress.ru ddr3 8gb

- habr.com - habr.com

  We get the menu. Move the mouse over the item - click. The menu item will open
  in a new window. The "_blank" parameter is responsible for this.

  To add your own items - open the HTML notepad in the editor
  menu file - open the site and enter the desired theme - save
  URL ( CTRL-C or mouse ) - paste URL into HTML file and generate
  menu item. Save the file. In the browser, click the refresh icon
  and the browser will show a new menu.

  You can go to youtube, find the desired channel, save the URL
  and create a menu item for this channel to quickly access this
  channel at the click of a mouse.

  For the weather, you need to create local menus because there in the URL will be
  city ??name. This menu allows you to make items for different
  weather services A simple mouse click opens a window with the weather service website.
  This is the fastest way to get weather and compare weather from different
  sites.

  For the Avito trading platform, the URL also contains the name of the city.
  Enter Avito in the topic of interest - save the URL - open
  notepad editor with menu HTML file and create a new menu item.

  In very large cities, you can create departure menu items
  trolleybus from the desired stop in the desired direction.
  The time of arrival of the trolleybus at the stop is shown.
  For electric trains, all trains from the desired stop are shown.

  The method is on github. For RU there are encoding problems.
  Here the encoding is windows-1251. Although they say you have to go
  to UTF-8.

  The method is convenient for saving links and transferring links to different
  computers. Another thing is that some qualification is needed for
  menu changes.

  Such menus can be added to assemblies. This is the final decision
  to quickly navigate to the desired topics on the sites.
